# Basic Algorithms
This repository contains basic algorithms I implemented to solve certain problems like:
- Generating the Fibonacci Sequence until numbers N(Iterative)
- Generating the Fibonacci Sequence until number N(Recursion)
- Finding the Largest Palindrome of the Product of 2 3-Digit numbers
- Two Sum: Finding 2 indexes in a given array that sum up to a target provided to the program
- Summations of Primes: Finding the sum of all prime numbers under 2 million through the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which is the most efficient at finding primes under 10 million
- Special Pythagorean Triplets: Finding the product of 3 numbers a, b, c where a < b < c and where the result of their pythagorean theorem is 1000
- Smallest Multiple: Finding the smallest multiple of the numbers between 1-20
- Square Sum Difference: Finding the difference between the sum of squares of the first 100 natural numbers and it's square of the sum
- Finding the 10001th Prime Number using Sieve of Erotosthenes
- Converting Roman Numerals under 3999 to integers 
- Finding the Greatest Common String for 2 input strings
- Merging & Sorting(Bubble Sort) 2 Sorted lists
- Remove Digit From Number to Maximize Result
- Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers between 100-999 where each digit is part of the input array and the integer does not have leading zeros
