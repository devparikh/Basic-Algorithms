# Algorithms
This repository contains basic algorithms I implemented to solve certain problems like:
- Generating the Fibonacci Sequence until a number n(Iteratively)
- Generating the Fibonacci Sequence until a number n(Recursively)
- Generating Factorials until a number n
- Finding the largest palindrome of the product of 2 3-Digit numbers
- Implemented Two Sum: Finding 2 indexes in a given array that sum up to a target provided to the program
- Summations of Primes: Finding the sum of all prime numbers under 2 million through the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which is the most efficient at finding primes under 10 million
