# Basic Algorithms
This repository contains basic algorithms I implemented to solve certain problems like:
- Iteratively generating the Fibonacci Sequence until numbers N
- Recursively generating the Fibonacci Sequence until number N
- Finding the largest palindrome of the product of 2 3-Digit numbers
- Implemented Two Sum: Finding 2 indexes in a given array that sum up to a target provided to the program
- Summations of Primes: Finding the sum of all prime numbers under 2 million through the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which is the most efficient at finding primes under 10 million
- Special Pythagorean Triplets - Finding the product of 3 numbers a, b, c where a < b < c and where the pythagorean theorum holds true for the variables they must sum up to 1000
- Smallest Multiple - Finding the smallest multiple of the numbers between 1-20
- Square Sum Difference - Finding the difference between the sum of squares of the first 100 natural numbers and it's square of the sum
- Finding the 10001th Prime Number using Sieve of Erotosthenes
- Converting Roman Numerals under 3999 to Integers
